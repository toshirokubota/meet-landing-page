## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned how to use background-blend-mode to mix an image and a tint color to make up a background image.

### Continued development

I want to make the page transit more smoothly with clamp(), but I forgot about it... I am writing this to remind myself to do it next time!

I also wanted to use more logical style properties instead of physical ones. I forgot about it, and I am writing here as a reminder to do it next time!

I still struggle (perhaps less than before but still) for some layouts, especially images and pseudo elements. I need more practice.
